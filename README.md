# Old Personal Website (Archived)

This repository contains the source code for my old personal website, built using pure HTML and CSS.  
The site is no longer in use or maintained — it's here for reference and archival purposes only.

## 📁 What's Inside

- `index.html` — Main homepage
- Additional `.html` files
- `css/` — Stylesheets
- `assets/` — Images, fonts, or other media

## 💡 Notes

- This project does not use any frameworks but uses JavaScript.
- Feel free to explore the code or use it as a starting point for your own site.
- No active updates or support.

## 📄 License
